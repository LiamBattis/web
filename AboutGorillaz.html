  <h2> About Gorillaz </h2>
       <p> Gorillaz' breakout album released in 2000. It was one of the world's first virtual band, meaning that the band members are not real people, 
         in Gorillaz' case they are cartoons. The band was created by Damon Alburn, who wrote and produced most of the Gorillaz music, and Jamie Hewlett,
         who animated the characters. The cartoon members of Gorillaz are Murdoc Niccols, 2-D, Russel Hobbs, and Noodle. In the Gorillaz story, Murdoc, a 
         green-skinned satanist, was the founder of the band. He recruited 2-D, the lead singer of the band who is known for his empty black eyes, Russel, 
         a drummer from Brooklyn who is haunted by spirits, and Noodle, the guitarist of the band, a genetically enchanced woman from Japan.
         Each character has a long and in depth backstory that develops throughout Gorillaz' 6 albums. </p>
