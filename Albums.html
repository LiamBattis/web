       <h2> Gorillaz' Albums </h2>
         <p> Gorillaz have released 6 albums in their career, Gorillaz (2000), Demon Dayz (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018),
           and Song Machine (2020). Their most critically aclaimed albums are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and Song Machine. However, my favorites by Gorillaz 
           are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and The Now Now. My favortie album by Gorillaz is probably Plastic Beach. I like this album so much for a few reasons.
           The band uses very artifical and plastic sounding synths that repeat throughout the album and really help to build on the theme throughout the album
           of a world made of plastic. The band also talks about issues such as climate change and the destruction of nature that I really appreciate. My favorite 
           songs from this ablum are Rhinestone Eyes, Plastic Beach, and Empire Ants. </P>
