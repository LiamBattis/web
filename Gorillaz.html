     <h2> About Gorillaz
       <p> Gorillaz' breakout album released in 2000. It was one of the world's first virtual band, meaning that the band members are not real people, 
         in Gorillaz' case they are cartoons. The band was created by Damon Alburn, who wrote and produced most of the Gorillaz music, and Jamie Hewlett,
         who animated the characters. The cartoon members of Gorillaz is Murdoc Niccols, 2-D, Russel Hobbs, and Noodle. Each character has a long and in depth
         backstory that develops throughout Gorillaz' 6 albums. <p>

       <h2> Gorillaz' Albums 
         <p> Gorillaz have released 6 albums in their career, Gorillaz (2000), Demon Dayz (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018),
           and Song Machine (2020). Their most critically aclaimed albums are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and Song Machine. However, my favorites by Gorillaz 
           are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and The Now Now. My favortie album by Gorillaz is probably Plastic Beach. I like this album so much for a few reasons.
           The band uses very artifical and plastic sounding synths that repeat throughout the album and really help to build on the theme throughout the album
           of a world made of plastic. The band also talks about issues such as climate change and the destruction of nature that I really appreciate. My favorite 
           songs from this ablum are Rhinestone Eyes, Plastic Beach, and Empire Ants. <P>

         <h2> Why I Like Gorillaz 
   <p>     There are multiple reasons why Gorillaz is my favorite band. One of the reasons I like Gorillaz so much is because they use so many different types of sounds in their songs.
        They are constantly experimenting with different instruments and no 2 gorillaz songs sound even a little bit similar. They also makes songs from many different genres.
           Gorillaz are usually labeled as an electirc rock band, though they have produced rap songs, jazz songs, EDM, and have even made a completely instrumental album called
           The Fall that I did not include in my list of Gorillaz albums. Another reason why I like Gorillaz is because they collaborate with so many artists. Gorillaz have 
           workerd with over 100 different artists in their career and have collaborated with eveyone from Snoop Dogg to Elton John. Almost every song on Plastic Beach has at least
           one feature from another artist on it which is yet another reason why I like it so much.
