  <h2> Why I Like Gorillaz </h2>
   <p>     There are multiple reasons why Gorillaz is my favorite band. One of the reasons I like Gorillaz so much is because they use so many different types of sounds in their songs.
        They are constantly experimenting with different instruments and no 2 gorillaz songs sound even a little bit similar. They also makes songs from many different genres.
           Gorillaz are usually labeled as an electirc rock band, though they have produced rap songs, jazz songs, EDM, and have even made a completely instrumental album called
           The Fall that I did not include in my list of Gorillaz albums. Another reason why I like Gorillaz is because they collaborate with so many artists. Gorillaz have 
           worked with over 100 different artists in their career and have collaborated with eveyone from Snoop Dogg to Elton John. Almost every song on Plastic Beach has at least
           one feature from another artist on it which is yet another reason why I like it so much. </p>
