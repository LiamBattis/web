<h1> Ecosytem Population Graphing Program </h1>
<h2> Liam Battis, Period 5 </h2>
 
<li> Project Description </li>

<p> My project is a program that takes information on the population numbers of animals in an ecosystem over time and
graphs them. </p>

<li> Instructions </li>

<p> There are already a few population data sets in the program. To see the graphs of the populations, you can run
the program. If you want to graph your own ecosystem, you can write plot_graph(data_set, n) in the Thonny shell
where data_set is the data on the populations of animals in your ecosystem and n is the number of animals in the data
  set. Make sure that your data set is in the form- </p>
<p><ul>['Year', 'First Animal', 'Second Animal', 'Third Animal', 'Fourth Animal', Year 1, Animal 1 Year 1 data, Animal 2 year 1 data, Animal 3 Year 1 data, Animal 4 Year 1 data, Year 2, Animal 1 Year 2 data...]</ul></p>
 <p>Example:</p>
<p><ul>['Year', 'Shark', 'Turtle', 'Jellyfish', 'Shrimp', 2000, 100, 300, 1000, 4000, 2005, 75, 400, 680, 7000, 2010, 50, 425, 660, 7500, 2015, 87, 350, 750, 6000]</ul></p>
<p>(Notice how only the word Year and the names of the animals are strings. The numeral values should not be strings. This is an easy
  mistake to make that would mess up the program.</p>


<li> How it Works </li>

<p> My Project works by taking the data set you want to graph and n, the number of animals in your data set, as inputs and running them through the function plot_graph.
Depending on the value of n, plot_graph creates n lists, one for each animal. To fill each list, the function 
make_y_value is run. make_y_value fills the list by checking if the index of each numeral value of the data_set is 
divisible by the animal's position in the dataset. If it is, the value is added to the list. This is done for every animal
in the data set. Then, plot_graph plots (x_value (which has already been created by make_x_value), y_value (which was just 
created by plot_y_value)). A label is also added to each animal that is plotted. The label is created by turning the xth index
of the data set into a string, where x is the animal's position in the data set. This works because the first n + 1 entries in
the data set is 'Year' and the name of each animal.</p>

<p>  <ul> final.html (This webpage) </ul>
  <ul>final.py (My python program)</ul>

<li> Recources </li>

<p> I had originally planned on taking data on populations of ecosystems from https://datadryad.org/stash and https://www.gbif.org/.
However, I was not able to find any data on these websites or anywhere else, so I decided to make up the data.
Other than these websites, I did not use any external recources on this project. </p>

<li> Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of </li>

<p><ul> If you decide to make your own data set, make sure that you format it just like how the example is formatted above.</ul>
<ul> The maximum number of animals you can have in your ecosystem is 5 </ul>
  <ul> I am not aware of any bugs or errors with the project </ul></p>
