     <h2> Album 1 - Gorillaz (2000) <h2>
       <p> Gorillaz' breakout album released in 2000. It was one of the world's first virtual band, meaning that the band members are not real people, 
         in Gorillaz' case they are cartoons. The band was created by Damon Alburn, who wrote and produced most of the Gorillaz music, and Jamie Hewlett,
         who animated the characters. The cartoon members of Gorillaz is Murdoc Niccols, 2-D, Russel Hobbs, and Noodle. Each character has a long and in depth
         backstory that develops throughout Gorillaz' 6 albums. <p>
       
       <h2> Gorillaz' Albums <h2>
         <p> Gorillaz have released 6 albums in their career, Gorillaz (2000), Demon Dayz (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018),
           and Song Machine (2020). Their most critically aclaimed albums are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and Song Machine. However, my favorites by Gorillaz 
           are Demon Dayz, Plastic Beach, and The Now Now. My favortie album by Gorillaz is probably Plastic Beach. I like this album so much for a few reasons.
           The band uses very artifical and plastic sounding synths that repeat throughout the album and really help to build on the theme throughout the album
           of a world made of plastic. The band also talks about issues such as climate change and the destruction of nature that I really appreciate. My favorite 
           songs from this ablum are Rhinestone Eyes, Plastic Beach, and Empire Ants.
