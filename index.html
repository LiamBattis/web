     <h2> Album 1 - Gorillaz (2000) <h2>
       <p> Gorillaz' breakout album released in 2000. It was one of the world's first virtual band, meaning that the band members are not real people, 
         in Gorillaz' case they are cartoons. The band was created by Damon Alburn, who wrote and produced most of the Gorillaz music, and Jamie Hewlett,
         who animated the characters. The cartoon members of Gorillaz is Murdoc Niccols, 2-D, Russel Hobbs, and Noodle. Each character has a long and in depth
         backstory that develops throughout Gorillaz' 6 albums. <p>
